## CSCI 4193/5193 Team 9 FoodX
This repository includes our team's code for our prototype, it has a front-end
UI and a functional Firebase back-end.

**1.** Our submission name on Brightspace:  **Group 9 Prototype**

**2.** The **Asana link** for this project is here: [Asana - Team9 FoodX](https://app.asana.com/0/1200019883141866/board)

**3.** Our **hosted website**:[Team 9-FoodX-Prototype](https://yijiew8.sg-host.com/)
   Note: One thing weird to see is when we want to direct to 'search' page, it will always show '404 Pgae not found'
   but the react app runs with no problem with our local host (we have tested that on 4 different devices)
   

**4.** The screenshots for Firebase are included in the **root directory** of this repository, named with **Firebase Screenshot-{1,2}**
       Also, we are using the authentication function provided by Firebase, so it is safe and will not include any password in the code;
       as for the API key provided by Firebase, we can configure the access in Firebase console to avoid unknown people abusing it.

**5.** Our **Figma** website to show the protorype:[Team 9-FoodX-Figma](https://www.figma.com/proto/4Kv3pbm5F7ApcqIRhlh85o/FoodX-Tech-innovation?node-id=52%3A211&scaling=contain&page-id=0%3A1)
